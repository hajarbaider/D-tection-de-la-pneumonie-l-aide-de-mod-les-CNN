# 🫁 Pneumonia Detection using CNN

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on the automatic detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images using Deep Learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

The objective is to assist medical professionals by providing a reliable and fast diagnostic support system.

This project compares multiple CNN architectures to identify the most efficient model for pneumonia classification.
